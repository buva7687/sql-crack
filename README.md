SQL Crack is a VS Code extension that visualizes SQL queries as interactive execution flow diagrams. Understand complex queries at a glance, track column lineage, and identify optimization opportunities with professional-grade visual analysis.

> Inspired by [JSON Crack](https://jsoncrack.com/) and Snowflake Query Profile

## Features

### Core Visualization

- **Execution Flow Visualization** — See how your SQL query executes step by step
- **Multi-Query Support** — Visualize multiple SQL statements with tab navigation (Q1, Q2, Q3...)
- **Query-Level Column Lineage** — Click any output column to trace its full transformation path from source tables through JOINs, aggregations, and calculations. Highlights relevant nodes and shows step-by-step lineage in a visual timeline.
  
  > **Note:** This is query-level lineage analysis based on SQL parsing — it traces columns within a single query's execution flow. It does not provide object-to-object lineage tracking across your database schema or metadata catalog.

- **Query Statistics** — Complexity score, table/join/filter counts, CTE depth, fan-out analysis, critical path length, and complexity breakdown with color-coded visual indicators

### Interactive Navigation

- **Click Node → Jump to SQL** — Click any node to instantly navigate to its definition in your SQL editor
- **Click Edge → View SQL Clauses** — Click connections to see JOIN conditions, WHERE clauses, and filters with line numbers
- **Breadcrumb Navigation** — Navigate through nested CTEs with an interactive breadcrumb trail showing the query hierarchy
- **Search Nodes** — Find nodes by name with `Ctrl+F` / `Cmd+F`
- **Focus Mode** — Highlight connected nodes for better understanding
- **Bidirectional Editor Sync** — Click in SQL editor to highlight flow nodes, click nodes to jump to SQL
- **Double-Click to Zoom/Expand** — Double-click standard nodes to focus on them and their immediate neighbors; double-click CTE/subquery nodes to open their cloud visualization
- **Enhanced Tooltips** — Hover over nodes to see actual SQL fragments, line numbers, and detailed operation information

### Smart Analysis & Quality

- **Read vs Write Visualization** — Clear visual distinction between data operations:
  - **READ** operations (Blue border + badge)
  - **WRITE** operations (Red border + badge)
  - **DERIVED** tables (Purple border + badge)
- **Operation Type Badges** — See INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, and CREATE TABLE AS operations at a glance
- **Advanced SQL Annotations** — Automatic detection of code quality issues: unused CTEs, dead columns, duplicate subqueries, and repeated table scans with visual warning badges
- **Smart Quality Warnings** — Hover over warning badges to see detailed explanations with severity levels (low/medium/high) and actionable suggestions
- **Anti-Pattern Detection** — Automatic detection of SQL anti-patterns:

| Issue | Severity |
|-------|----------|
| `SELECT *` usage | Warning |
| Missing `LIMIT` clause | Info |
| `DELETE`/`UPDATE` without `WHERE` | Error |
| Excessive JOINs (5+) | Warning |
| Cartesian products | Error |

### CTE & Subquery Visualization

- **Floating Cloud Design** — CTEs and subqueries display their internal operations in an elegant floating cloud panel with full-size nodes (180x60px) matching the main canvas for complete visibility of table names and operations
- **Double-Click to Open** — Double-click any CTE or subquery node to expand and view its internal flow in the floating cloud panel
- **Dedicated Close Button** — Each cloud has a red X button in the top-right corner for explicit closing (double-click only opens, never closes)
- **Independent Pan & Zoom** — Each cloud container has its own pan and zoom controls:
  - Drag inside the cloud to pan the internal view
  - Scroll wheel inside the cloud to zoom (0.5x to 2x range)
  - Main canvas pan/zoom remains unaffected
- **Draggable Cloud Positioning** — Drag the cloud container by its border to reposition it anywhere on the canvas; the connecting arrow automatically adjusts to the correct side
- **Full Tooltips in Cloud** — Hover over any node inside the cloud to see detailed tooltips with SQL fragments, line numbers, and operation details
- **Default Collapsed** — CTEs and subqueries start collapsed by default to reduce visual clutter; expand on demand to explore their internal structure

### Display & Export

- **View Location Toggle** — Choose where to display: beside editor, new tab, or secondary sidebar
- **Pin Visualizations** — Save query snapshots as separate tabs for comparison
- **Persistent Pins** — Pinned tabs survive VS Code restarts
- **Theme Support** — Dark and light themes with grid pattern background
- **PNG Export** — High-DPI images with background
- **SVG Export** — Vector format for scalable diagrams
- **Clipboard Copy** — Quick sharing via clipboard

   - Click the **graph icon** in the editor title bar
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+V` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows/Linux)
   - Right-click → **"SQL Crack: Visualize SQL Query"**

### Interactive Features

- **Navigate to SQL**: Click any node to jump to its definition in the editor
- **View SQL Clauses**: Click edge connections to see JOIN conditions and WHERE clauses
- **Navigate CTEs**: Use the breadcrumb trail at the top to navigate through nested Common Table Expressions
- **Expand CTEs & Subqueries**: Double-click any CTE or subquery node to open its floating cloud panel with full-size nodes; use the X button to close
- **Cloud Navigation**: Pan and zoom independently within cloud containers; drag clouds by their border to reposition
- **View Details**: Hover over any node (including those inside clouds) to see SQL fragments and line numbers
- **Zoom & Pan**: Use mouse wheel to zoom, drag to pan, or double-click standard nodes to focus on them and their neighbors

## Roadmap

SQL Crack follows a phased development approach focused on delivering professional-grade SQL visualization features:

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Professional Features (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Enhanced interactive navigation (click-to-jump, edge highlighting, breadcrumbs)
- ✅ Read vs Write differentiation with visual badges
- ✅ Enhanced tooltips with SQL fragments and line numbers
- ✅ CTE expansion controls with breadcrumb navigation
- ✅ Fullscreen mode with UI element hiding
- ✅ Click-to-jump navigation with source document tracking
- ✅ Edge click to view SQL clauses (JOIN/WHERE conditions)

### ✅ Phase 2: Developer Productivity & Quality (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Advanced SQL annotations and warnings (unused CTEs, dead columns, duplicate subqueries, repeated table scans)
- ✅ Query complexity insights (CTE depth, fan-out analysis, critical path length, complexity breakdown)
- ✅ Smart quality warnings with severity levels and actionable suggestions
- ✅ Query-level column lineage visualization (click-to-trace with full transformation path)
- ✅ Floating cloud design for CTE and subquery visualization with full-size nodes matching main canvas
- ✅ Independent pan/zoom within cloud containers for complex subquery navigation
- ✅ Draggable cloud positioning with dynamic arrow adjustment
- ✅ Dedicated close button (X) for explicit cloud dismissal
- ✅ Enhanced CTE parsing to handle various AST structures from node-sql-parser
- 📅 Diff-aware visualization for PR reviews (Planned)

### 📅 Phase 3: Static Performance Analysis (Planned)
- Heuristic-based optimization hints (filter pushdown, join order, repeated scans)
- Anti-pattern detection with actionable suggestions
- Query structure analysis for potential bottlenecks

> **Note:** True query plan analysis and cost-based optimization require database connectivity, which is outside the scope of this local-only tool.

### 📅 Phase 4: Workspace Awareness (Planned)
- Cross-file lineage tracking (parse SQL files to build dependency graphs)
- dbt integration (parse `ref()`, `source()` macros and YAML configs)
- Workspace-wide table/view dependency visualization
